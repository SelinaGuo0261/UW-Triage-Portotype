Return only strict JSON for a UW agreement triage graph with nodes and edges. Use this schema:
{
  "flowName": string,
  "description": string,
  "nodes": [
    {"tempId": string, "type": "DEFINITION|DECISION|ACTION|PEOPLE", "label": string, "content": object, "answers": [{"tempId": string, "text": string, "order": number, "rationale": string}]}
  ],
  "edges": [{"sourceNodeTempId": string, "sourceAnswerTempId": string|null, "targetNodeTempId": string}]
}
Rules:
- **candidatePoints lockstep (mandatory when ## candidatePoints appears below):** Emit **exactly one** `nodes[]` entry per candidate point, in the **same order** as the JSON list. Set each node's **`tempId` to that point's `id`** (e.g. `pt-1`, `pt-2`). **Do not merge, skip, or summarize** multiple points into one node. If a point is `likelyKind` DEFINITION|DECISION|ACTION|PEOPLE|UNKNOWN, map to the graph type (UNKNOWN → best guess ACTION or DECISION).
- **Edges from `predecessorId`:** For every point with non-null `predecessorId` = P, add **one** directed edge **from** node tempId P **to** this node's tempId. Source convention: from DEFINITION or ACTION use `sourceAnswerTempId` null. From a DECISION with multiple children sharing the same predecessor, create **one DECISION answer per distinct child** (each answer text reflects that branch) and set each edge's `sourceAnswerTempId` to the answer that leads to that child. When one DECISION forks to K children in candidatePoints, the DECISION node must have **at least K answers** and **K outgoing edges** (one per answer to the matching child tempId).
- exactly one candidate point may be DEFINITION (`likelyKind` DEFINITION); the graph must have exactly one DEFINITION node (same tempId as that point).
- DEFINITION content must include description, relatedOffices, templates, and resources
- DEFINITION has exactly one outgoing edge to the next node (DECISION, ACTION, or PEOPLE as appropriate). A flow may have zero DECISION nodes if the process is linear or single-outcome.
- If you include DECISION nodes, each DECISION answer must have an outgoing edge
- ACTION nodes may have **0 or 1** outgoing edge only. Use sourceAnswerTempId null on that edge (same convention as from DEFINITION). 0 = terminal outcome for that path; 1 = continue to the next ACTION, DECISION, or PEOPLE. Never attach more than one outgoing edge from the same ACTION.
- DECISION nodes represent branching: use **two or more answers** when the source document has a real fork; a **single-answer** DECISION is allowed only for linear "continue" steps. Each answer must have exactly one outgoing edge. Allowed flows include ACTION→ACTION, ACTION→DECISION, DECISION→ACTION, and DECISION→DECISION.
- For each DECISION answer, include **"rationale"**: a short sentence (判断依据) citing how the document supports choosing that branch; use empty string "" if none.
- ACTION content must include title, description, assigneeKind, assignee, and materials
- ACTION content.materials must be a JSON array (possibly empty) of objects like {"label":"..."}; never a single object or string at the top level
- materials attachKind must be null and attachValue must be empty
- Include at least one ACTION result.
- DECISION nodes must set content.question (string) for the end-user wizard; keep node.label aligned with that question when possible.
- **Coverage over connectivity:** With **candidatePoints lockstep** above, **`nodes.length` must equal the number of candidate points** in the JSON. **Do not drop nodes** to simplify.
- **If there is no candidatePoints block** below: the graph **need not be fully connected**; ACTION/DECISION may have zero incoming edges when wiring is uncertain. With candidatePoints + `predecessorId`, wire every non-root point from its predecessor as above.
- Linear procedures: chain ACTION→ACTION or ACTION→DECISION with at most one edge per ACTION when you do wire them; use multi-answer DECISION only for branches (typically 2+ options). Prefer explicit stages rather than merging unrelated obligations into one node.
- Use double-quoted JSON keys and string values only. No comments. No trailing commas.
